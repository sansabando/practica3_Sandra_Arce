During this proyect, I worked on transforming a shooter game into a progressive web application (PWA), adding features to improve the user experience. Among the tasks performed, I created a manifest.json file, where I defined the basic information of the application, such as its name, icons, and colors, allowing the game to be installed on mobile or desktop devices. I also developed a Service Worker, which is responsible for caching essential game resources, ensuring that the game can be played even without an internet connection. In addition, I implemented an install button that interacts with the beforeinstallprompt event, making it possible for the user to install the game directly from the browser.

Initially, I tried to work on Glitch. However, I ran into technical problems, as the tool stopped responding during the process. This led me to migrate the project to GitHub.dev, where I was able to continue moving forward, although this platform presented certain important limitations. For example, I encountered restrictions related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which prevented the browser from accessing the manifest.json file. This directly affected the game's ability to be recognized as a progressive web app. I also detected that some resources, such as icons, were not loading correctly due to internal redirection issues on the platform. In addition, the browser generated an additional error when trying to load a favicon.ico file that was not included in the project.

Despite these difficulties, I managed to complete the essential configurations to transform the game into a PWA. Most of the problems were related to the platforms used, which were not entirely suitable for this type of project.
